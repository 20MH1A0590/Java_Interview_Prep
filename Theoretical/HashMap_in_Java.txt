HashMap in Java:
================

* What is HashMap.?

	-> HashMap is a DataStructure that allows to store and retrive the Key-Value pair.It is a part of Collections Framework in Java.

	-> Keys must be unique whereas Values may or may not be Unique.
	
	-> Both Keys and Values may be of any Datatype(Primitive).


* Where we use HashMaps.?

	For an Example,->If we have a Student Data. I want to store only rollnumber and marks in the key-value pair.In this Scenario We use 	HashMap and Student Roll Number must be unique because Each and every student have an individual roll number.

	-> Items Vs Prices, In this case items must be Unique whereas prices may or may not be unique.


* How to Declare HashMap in Java.?

	Basically we have two types of Declarations of HashMap.
	
	-> For ex : HashMap<Integer, Integer> Freq = new HashMap<>();  is one way of declaring the HashMap in Java.
			-------------------------------------------------								
	   	In the above declaration, Ordering is not maintained.It mean HashMap can stores key-value pair at anywhere.

	-> For ex : Map<Integer, Integer> Freq = new LinkedHashMap<>(); is another way of declaring the HashMap in Java.
	            ---------------------------------------------------
	  	In the above declaration,Ordering is maintained by HashMap.

	-> Simply map Vs unorderedmap in C++.


* How to Push the Element into the HashMap in Java.?

	We have Map.put() function to insert or push the element into the HashMap.
		  ---------
	-> For ex : Map.put(a[i], Map.get(a[i])+1); is the syntax to update the value of HashMap, if Key already exists in HashMap.
                  -------------------------------
	-> Map.put(a[i],1) If key not exits, then insert into The HashMap with value 1.
	   ---------------


* How can we run a loop over HashMap in Java.?

	-> we Have Many ways to run a loop over HashMap.

	-> Best way among those is
		
	   For( Datatype iterator : KeySet()) 

		-> above loop iterates all the keys in HashMap.


* How can Retrieve the Value of a Particular Key in HashMap.?

	-> For this We have map.get() function
				  ---------
		Syntax : map.get(keyname);


* Import Methods or Functions We use in implementation of HashMap in Java.
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 -> Map.put()

 -> Map.keySet()
	
 -> Map.Values()

 -> Map.get()
